<span> <ng-content /> </span>
<span class="icon">
  <ng-content select="icon" />
</span>

<!-- The projection mechanism has been updated to use ngProjectAs instead of CSS classes, which is a more explicit and controlled approach to content projection. -->
<!-- Angular sees <span ngProjectAs="icon">▸</span> and treats it as having the "icon" identifier
The <ng-content select="icon" /> captures this content
The remaining text "Submit" or "Logout" goes to the default <ng-content />

<span>Submit</span>
<span class="icon">▸</span> -->
