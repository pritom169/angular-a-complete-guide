<span> <ng-content /> </span>
<ng-content select=".icon" />

<!-- The content projection in the button component is using Angular's <ng-content> feature to create a flexible, reusable button template.

This creates two "slots" where content can be projected:

1. The first <ng-content /> (without a selector) captures ALL content by default
2. The second <ng-content select=".icon" /> specifically captures only elements with the CSS class "icon" -->
